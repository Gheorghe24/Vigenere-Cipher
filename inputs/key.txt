THIS IS JUST SOME RANDOM TEXT THAT YOU HAPPENED TO FIND HERE. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SEE.
ESPECIALLY NOT A SECRET KEY, WHO WOULD PUT A SECRET KEY INSIDE A PLAIN TEXT FILE?
SO NOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NO KEY HERE YOU CAN START LOOKING SOMEWHERE ELSE.
OH, YOU ARE STILL HERE. SO YOU REALLY THINK THAT THIS TEXT HAS A KEY IN IT.
IN THAT CASE, GOOD LUCK FINDING IT.
BEFORE YOU GO, DID YOU KNOW THAT
